# Module 04 - Complete Exercise Alignment

## ✅ Source Code Now Reflects All Three Exercises

Just like Module 03, the Module 04 source code now demonstrates everything students will build across all three exercises.

## Exercise Coverage

### Exercise 01 - JWT Implementation ✅
**Source Code Includes:**
- JWT token generation (`JwtTokenService.cs`)
- Login endpoint (`/api/auth/login`)
- Protected endpoint (`/api/auth/protected`)
- Token validation
- Proper authentication middleware setup

### Exercise 02 - Role-Based Authorization ✅
**Source Code Includes:**
- Multiple roles (Admin, Editor, User, Employee)
- Role-based policies
- `AdminController` with admin-only endpoints
- `EditorController` with editor/admin endpoints
- Test users with different roles

### Exercise 03 - Custom Authorization Policies ✅
**Source Code Includes:**
- Custom requirements:
  - `MinimumAgeRequirement`
  - `DepartmentRequirement`
  - `WorkingHoursRequirement`
- Authorization handlers for each requirement
- Complex policies:
  - Age-based (Adult 18+)
  - Department-based (IT Department)
  - Time-based (Business Hours 9-5)
  - Combined (SeniorITStaff)
- `PolicyController` demonstrating all custom policies

## Test Users Available

| Username | Password | Roles | Department | Age | Exercise Demo |
|----------|----------|-------|------------|-----|----------------|
| admin | admin123 | Admin, Editor, User, Employee | IT | 38 | All exercises |
| user | user123 | User | General | N/A | Exercise 01 |
| editor | editor123 | Editor, User | Content | N/A | Exercise 02 |
| senior_dev | senior123 | Employee, Developer | IT | 38 | Exercise 03 |
| junior_dev | junior123 | Employee, Developer | IT | 22 | Exercise 03 |

## Root Endpoint

When students access the root URL, they see:
```json
{
  "message": "JWT Authentication & Authorization API - Complete Module 04",
  "version": "1.0",
  "documentation": "/swagger",
  "exercises": {
    "exercise01_jwt": [...],
    "exercise02_roles": [...],
    "exercise03_policies": [...]
  },
  "testUsers": [...]
}
```

## Testing All Exercises

### Exercise 01 Test:
```bash
# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:5219/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin123"}'

# Protected endpoint
curl -X GET http://localhost:5219/api/auth/protected \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Exercise 02 Test:
```bash
# Admin dashboard (requires Admin role)
curl -X GET http://localhost:5219/api/admin/dashboard \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Editor content (requires Editor or Admin)
curl -X GET http://localhost:5219/api/editor/content \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer EDITOR_TOKEN"
```

### Exercise 03 Test:
```bash
# Adult content (age 18+)
curl -X GET http://localhost:5219/api/policy/adult-content \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer SENIOR_DEV_TOKEN"

# IT resources (IT department)
curl -X GET http://localhost:5219/api/policy/it-resources \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Business hours (9-5 only)
curl -X GET http://localhost:5219/api/policy/business-hours \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ANY_TOKEN"
```

## Summary

The Module 04 source code now:
- ✅ Demonstrates all concepts from Exercise 01, 02, and 03
- ✅ Provides working examples of every authorization pattern
- ✅ Includes test users for all scenarios
- ✅ Shows clear progression from basic JWT to complex policies
- ✅ Compiles and runs without errors
- ✅ Returns helpful info at root URL (no 404)

Students can:
1. Follow the exercises to build each feature
2. Compare their implementation with the complete source code
3. Test all authorization scenarios
4. Learn from the comprehensive example
