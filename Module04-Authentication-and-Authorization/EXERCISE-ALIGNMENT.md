# Module 04 - Exercise and Source Code Alignment

## ✅ Perfect Alignment

The source code **exceeds** what the exercise asks for, providing students with more examples to learn from.

## Exercise Requirements vs Source Code

### Exercise 01 Requirements:
1. **POST /api/auth/login** - User authentication ✅
2. **GET /api/auth/protected** - Protected test endpoint ✅
3. JWT token generation ✅
4. Token validation ✅
5. Proper error handling ✅

### Source Code Provides:
1. **POST /api/auth/login** ✅ (line 32 in AuthController)
2. **GET /api/auth/protected** ✅ (line 201 in AuthController)
3. **POST /api/auth/register** ✅ (bonus - registration endpoint)
4. **GET /api/auth/profile** ✅ (bonus - profile endpoint)
5. **GET /api/auth/admin-only** ✅ (bonus - role-based endpoint)
6. **GET /api/auth/user-area** ✅ (bonus - policy-based endpoint)

## Root URL Solution

Instead of a 404 error or complex HTML page, the source code returns a simple JSON response:

```json
{
  "message": "JWT Authentication API",
  "version": "1.0",
  "documentation": "/swagger",
  "endpoints": [
    "POST /api/auth/login - Login with username and password",
    "POST /api/auth/register - Register new user",
    "GET /api/users/profile - Get current user profile (requires authentication)",
    "GET /api/users - Get all users (requires Admin role)"
  ]
}
```

This approach:
- ✅ Prevents 404 errors
- ✅ Shows the API is working
- ✅ Provides helpful endpoint information
- ✅ Stays minimal (doesn't add complexity beyond the exercise)
- ✅ Matches REST API style (returns JSON)

## Test Credentials (Already in UserService)

The source code includes hardcoded test users:
- **Admin**: username: `admin`, password: `admin123`
- **User**: username: `user`, password: `user123`

## Bonus Features in Source Code

The source code includes several features that align with the exercise's "Challenge Tasks":

1. **User Registration** (Challenge 1) ✅
   - Registration endpoint implemented
   - Input validation included

2. **Role-Based Authorization** (Challenge 2) ✅
   - Admin-only endpoint
   - User roles implemented
   - Policy-based authorization

## Summary

The source code:
- ✅ Implements everything the exercise requires
- ✅ Includes helpful bonus features for learning
- ✅ Provides a working API without 404 errors
- ✅ Gives students more examples to study
- ✅ Follows best practices

Students can:
1. Complete the exercise by building the basic requirements
2. Compare their solution with the more comprehensive source code
3. Learn additional patterns from the bonus features
